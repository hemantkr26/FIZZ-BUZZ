# FIZZ-BUZZ

**Description**

The FizzBuzz problem is a common programming challenge used in coding interviews to test a candidate's ability to implement conditional logic. The goal is to iterate through a series of integers and print specific outputs based on the divisibility of each integer.

**Requirements**

For each integer in a given series:

1. Print "FIZZ" if the number is a multiple of 3.
2. Print "BUZZ" if the number is a multiple of 5.
3. Print "FIZZ-BUZZ" if the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5.
4. Print the integer itself if it is not a multiple of either 3 or 5.
